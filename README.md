# picoCTF
This repository contains my personal write-ups and solutions for PicoCTF challenges. It covers topics such as cryptography, web security, reverse engineering, forensics, and binary exploitation. The goal is to document my approach, tools, and reasoning while building practical cybersecurity skills
# picoCTF Practice RepoThis repository serves as a practice ground for picoCTF challenges. It contains solutions, write-ups, and notes for various categories.## Table of Contents- [Introduction](#introduction)- [Challenges](#challenges)- [Setup](#setup)- [Contributing](#contributing)- [License](#license)## IntroductionpicoCTF is a free computer security game with original content built by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. This repository is my personal space to document my journey through the challenges, learn new techniques, and improve my cybersecurity skills.## ChallengesChallenges are organized by category and then by year (if applicable). Each challenge will have its own directory containing:- `solution.py` (or appropriate language) - The script or code used to solve the challenge.- `writeup.md` - A detailed explanation of the challenge, the thought process, tools used, and the steps taken to arrive at the solution.- `flag.txt` (or similar) - The captured flag (for reference, though its best not to hardcode flags in public repos if youre still actively competing or if the challenge is ongoing).###
